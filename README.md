## Steps to Develop the API 
1. Set up dependencies, including libraries like Flask.
2. Develop the code logic.
3. Establish routes and endpoints.
4. Verify the code's functionality using Postman.

## Utilizing the API
1. Access the API through the provided URL endpoint.
2. Configure the method as POST.
3. Send a request via Postman using raw JSON in the request body, structured as <br />
   {"sentence" : "Running is the optimal way to commence the day"}.
4. Retrieve and review the response.


# Tools We Use
- Visual Studio Code to Develop the code logic.
- Postman to test API 
- Cloud Build to deploy API
- Cloud Storage for archiving dataset, machine learning model, etc
- Cloud Run to deploy API
- Github to repository, deploy API, etc
